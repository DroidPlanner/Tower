/**
 * Class transforming a symmetrical matrix to tridiagonal shape.
 * <p>A symmetrical m &times; m matrix A can be written as the product of three matrices:
 * A = Q &times; T &times; Q<sup>T</sup> with Q an orthogonal matrix and T a symmetrical
 * tridiagonal matrix. Both Q and T are m &times; m matrices.</p>
 * <p>This implementation only uses the upper part of the matrix, the part below the
 * diagonal is not accessed at all.</p>
 * <p>Transformation to tridiagonal shape is often not a goal by itself, but it is
 * an intermediate step in more general decomposition algorithms like {@link
 * EigenDecomposition eigen decomposition}. This class is therefore intended for internal
 * use by the library and is not public. As a consequence of this explicitly limited scope,
 * many methods directly returns references to internal arrays, not copies.</p>
