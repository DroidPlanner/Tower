/**
 * This class defines a linear operator operating on real ({@code double})
 * vector spaces. No direct access to the coefficients of the underlying matrix
 * is provided.
 *
 * The motivation for such an interface is well stated by
 * <a href="#BARR1994">Barrett et al. (1994)</a>:
 * <blockquote>
 *  We restrict ourselves to iterative methods, which work by repeatedly
 *  improving an approximate solution until it is accurate enough. These
 *  methods access the coefficient matrix A of the linear system only via the
 *  matrix-vector product y = A &middot; x
 *  (and perhaps z = A<sup>T</sup> &middot; x). Thus the user need only
 *  supply a subroutine for computing y (and perhaps z) given x, which permits
 *  full exploitation of the sparsity or other special structure of A.
