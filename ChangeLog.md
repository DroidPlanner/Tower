# DroidPlanner ChangeLog
Our convention for release control is the following (for a release like DPvA.B.C_RCx):
* A - Main version, changes just with big changes in the app structure or/and layout
* B - Minor version, add's some significant feature to the app
* C - Minor changes with bugfixes, or small refactorings, from previous "A" or "B" changes.
* x - Releases Candidates (RC) are build from the main releases, but may have some feature's disabled. The "x" is used if multiple RC are needed for a new version of the app.

All the changes are logged below (preferable with the pull request numbers in parenteses):
