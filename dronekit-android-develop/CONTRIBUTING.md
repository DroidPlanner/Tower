# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/DroneKit-Android.git

Make your change. Compile and test the results ([help?](https://github.com/Droidplanner/Tower/wiki/Build-Setup)):

    ./gradlew clean build

Make sure your classpath is pointing to Java 1.7. 

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/Droidplanner/DroneKit-Android/compare/

We have an automated CI server running, which will try to compile your PR. Having that build successfully complete is a good sign.

Now you just need to get some reply from us. We like to review PRs, and make comments if something needs to be changed to match our project syle.
