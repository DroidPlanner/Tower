============================================
Welcome to DroneKit-Android's documentation!
============================================

DroneKit-Android provides interfaces for Android applications to control 3DR-powered vehicles. We support planes and copters built using the open-source ArduPilot flight control software. DroneKit enables developers to write new applications quickly and easily that push the boundaries of autonomous vehicle navigation.

DroneKit is compatible with all vehicles using the `MAVLink protocol <http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start>`_. This includes most vehicles made by 3DR and other members of the `DroneCode foundation <https://www.dronecode.org/about/project-members>`_.
